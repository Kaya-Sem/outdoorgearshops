<h1 align="center">Outdoor Gear Shops</h1>

   A simple outdoor gear shop aggregator that drew inspiration from [litetrek](https://litetrek.eu/), which I've found useful - but it's somewhat outdated. This version aims to be a cleaner and more current alternative.

If you have favorite niche cottage brands or stores I’ve missed, please let me know — I'd be happy to add them!


### Setup
The site is contained in a single `html` file right now for simplicity reasons. I am not a huge fan of premature optimisation. If things grow, the data could be extracted into its own file, just like the javascript.
